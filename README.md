## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **npm** (or yarn)
- An **OpenAI API key** (for GPT-4 integration)

---

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/INTSEAN/jobify.git
```

Then, navigate to the project directory:

```bash

cd jobify
```

### Server Setup

Navigate to the server folder:

```bash

cd server

```

Install dependencies:

```bash

npm install
```

Configure Environment Variables:

Create a `.env` file in the server directory and add the following:
```env
PORT=5000
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
# Add any additional server-specific variables as needed
```

### Client Setup

Open a new terminal window/tab and navigate to the client folder:
```bash
cd client
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
Adjust any client-side configurations if necessary (e.g., API endpoints).

### Environment Variables

Ensure that your API keys and other sensitive data are kept secure. The primary environment variable for the server is:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for GPT-4 access.

---

## Running the Application

You can run both the server and the client concurrently. If you have a root-level script set up (e.g., using the concurrently package), simply run from the project root:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Alternatively, run them in separate terminal windows:

Start the Server:
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

Start the Client:
```bash
cd client
npm start
```

By default, the client will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the server at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) (or as specified in your `.env` file).

## Usage

Once the application is running:

- **Generate a Cover Letter:**
  - Choose a cover letter template.
  - Input your details as prompted.
  - Click the "Generate" button to create your cover letter using GPT-4.

- **Preview and Download:**
  - Review the generated cover letter.
  - Use the download option to save your cover letter locally.

- **Interview Preparation:**
  - Engage with the voice AI-powered interview simulation.
  - Receive real-time feedback and analysis to boost your interview readiness.

## Deployment

Jobify can be deployed on various cloud platforms such as Vercel, Heroku, or AWS. When deploying, make sure to:

- Set up your environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) in your production environment.
- Configure your build settings appropriately for both client and server.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Dependency Issues:** Ensure you are using the correct Node.js version. If issues persist, try deleting `node_modules` and your lock file (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`), then reinstall dependencies.
- **Environment Variables:** Verify that your `.env` file in the server directory is correctly configured.
- **Port Conflicts:** If default ports (3000 for client, 5000 for server) are busy, update the configuration to use alternative ports.
- **API Errors:** Double-check that your OpenAI API key is valid and that your network connection is stable.
